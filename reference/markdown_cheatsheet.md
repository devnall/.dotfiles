## Tables

Note: Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and _Markdown Here_ supports them.

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each leader cell.
Colons placed on the dash lines can be used to align columns.

The outer pipes (|) are optional.
You don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily.
You can also use inline Markdown.

Leader cell titles are always bolded.

```
| Tables        | Are            | Cool  |
| ------------- |:--------------:| -----:|
| Col 2 is      | center-aligned | $1600 |
| Col 3 is      | right-aligned  |   $16 |
| zebra stripes | are neat       |    $1 |
```
