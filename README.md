/dev/nall's dotfiles
--------------------

A bunch of dotfiles for my environment, including:
* BASH (deprecated)
* zsh
* vim
* screen (deprecated)
* tmux

These are a work in progress (and likely always will be) and are in dire need of a cleanup.

The (deprecated) stuff isn't really being used in my current environment but I'm keeping it around in case I end up on an old box without the new hotness.
